Depends which day you catch them on,
  whether SJW's will deign to answer you.
As the W implies, they see themselves at war,
  where practicalities like attrition can kill
and rules of engagement dictate no prisoners are kept.
  They would only be liabilities--the enemy is already lost.
Weary of eternal recurrence, they meet earnest questions cynically--
  "It is not up to me. Figure it out yourself."
I believe they have a point, albeit shallow and dull,
  for we all have a moral duty to improve ourselves
but it's a mere tautology when learning can lead anywhere.

True the internet holds each argument and concept, but
  you access them through searches, and Google is a many-faced god.
Even then the question holds loaded words--
  implicit biases that will color what knowledge we receive.
Say we follow your edict to see after our own questions and draw conclusions
  that entrench our problematic beliefs with confirmation bias.
Despite your intentions, the No Man's Land lengthens between us.
  The war becomes that much harder to ever resolve.
Communication was deliberately muddied and noxious, weaponized
  as a plague and escalating of the arms race.
Can we come back from the brink of conflict everlasting?
