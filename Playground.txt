America feels reduced in 2017, held back a grade
  or several, maybe so far as the beginning of elementary school?
The bully pulpit of our highest office turned over to a bully
  scary only for his resilience against any rules we've known,
and his senile rantings magicking us into rowdy children.
  To wit, look how I'm already regressed. I'm not wrong
yet in this climate we're all culpable.

Justice is at recess now with all the rest,
  Congress ignoring the transformation of government.
King of the jungle gym surrounds himself with Yes-Men
  as leadership self-selects ouf ot ignored posts and councils.
They think they stand a better shot at change outside,
overlooking just how bad things look without integrity in office.
Asphalt starts to burn under our feet.

The lies are too much to keep astride of,
his supporters don't care for the he said/she said.
Hell, even if its literally he said and he said,
fake news is out to get him, who'll listen?
"I'm rubber, you're glue" the Conman-in-Chief sneers,
preemptively and baselessly accusing opponents of his own faults,
simultaneously obfuscating and normalizing his tactics.

Power-hungry playmates plug their ears
and close their eyes like the monkeys who see no evil,
won't hear it or speak out for their supposed values.
In the cacophony it's enough that Trump sounds more like them.
Talks like them, walks like them,
maybe they're all not-sees.
Not like they care what we call them, we're biased.

Right now we're drumming up support amongst our own,
beating the drums in our echo chambers prior to conflict.
Post-truth makes intellectual giants to be kids
and a bombastic Trump to be their equal.
By the time we clash, words may be meaningless
and law thusly powerless, making our only outlet violence.
Will it still look like a playground after that?
