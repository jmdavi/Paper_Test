Neil Gaiman's The Sandman was a deeply personal epic, following characters called the Endless, embodiments of aspects of the universe including Dream, Desire, Destiny, Death, and others. Much of the series' appeal comes from the family dynamics between these Endless, as well as the ambitious scope of serialized storytelling and imagination on display. This Sandman tackles topics like one's capacity for change and the power of stories. While Gaiman's work brought finality to Dream's incarnation, this sequel follows Desire, as the brother/sister adapts to Dream's absence and the role he/she played in what occurred.

Gaiman's original series follows the embodiment of Dream, commonly called Morpheus, through his stewardship of his realm. Following decades-long imprisonment at the start of the series, Dream reclaims his realm and experiences newfound empathy after his trials. Piecemeal, Morpheus sets up a successor in the human child named Daniel and decides to die, reincarnating as a new manifestation of Dream in Daniel.
Gaiman weaves a family drama in the background of the Sandman saga. One of Dream's most fraught relationships is with his androgynous sister/brother Desire. From the machinations of creating a vortex (Rose Walker) during Morpheus’ decade-long capture by the cult in issue 1 to Dream’s doomed romance with Thessaly before the Kindly Ones arc, Desire consistently antagonized Morpheus in a predatory game of cat and mouse. That game ends without resolution via Morpheus’ weary succumbing/suicide to protect his realm from the Fates, a conclusion that sparks ambiguous feelings in Desire. During Morpheus’ wake, Desire states, “...”

These unresolved feelings are a great inspiration for a sequel volume centering on Desire. We’ve already seen Destruction’s abdication of his realm and Dream’s own passing from one incarnation to the next, so it is an appropriate theme to develop. Whereas Vol. 2 portrayed Desire with a certain feline, playful-and-impetuous character, I propose that the trauma of Morpheus’ decision shocks Desire into self-reflection and contemplation of non-existence—such is the legacy of his/her family recently. This impulse originates as a suicidal one, perhaps with strains of Buddhist enlightenment about escaping suffering by killing Desire; yet the series arcs towards growth and evolution, key characteristics of Desire’s ephemeral nature.
Morpheus’ conflict often arose from the character’s relative inability to change weighing that character down, and Desire’s story can celebrate how life represents the beauty of, and capacity for, change. Morpheus and Desire are different characters so this should not negate Morpheus’ story, but hopefully it adds a layer of optimism in how our choices shape us. Morpheus wished to change more than he thought himself capable, and Desire adapts beyond any will or intentionality to do so. This characterization can start small, like a check on the cruelty that Desire sometimes expresses when interacting with others, maturing with the series. Gradually Desire self-influences itself into healthy and productive habits and goals, eventually embracing that self-preserving facet of her/himself.
