These are a series of writings, which are in Github to facilitate version control. It will allow me both to keep a repository of writings that are generally lost or overwritten, to trace the evolution of the writings.

First poem, "Educate Yourself", is about the radical left's erasure of debate, tying in themes of warfare to show why they may take such approaches and why they may be flawed.

Second poem, "Playground", is about the powerlessness of resistance without common decency, where we are all denigrated by the current political climate.
